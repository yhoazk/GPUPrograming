# Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)



*BSP also stands for Board support package* which is the software provided by
the board vendor with the specific set of drivers and configurations.

Many paralled languages dont describe data placement so that the performance is
not predictable as a function of the source program. This is because data
placement depends on the language implementation, not its semantics.

On the contrary bulk synchronous parallel computing paradigm demostrates that
programs explicitly written for static number of *p* processors can have
predictable execution costs on a wide variety of architectures.

BSP attackts this problem from a functional programming perspecive.
